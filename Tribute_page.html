      <h2> Education and Research Career</h2>
      <ui>
        <li>Bose was born in Calcutta(now Kolkata),India on <b>January 1<sup>st</sup> 1894</b> </li>
        <li>His schooling began at the age of five, near his home. When his family moved to Goabagan, he was admitted into the New Indian School. In the final year of school, he was admitted into the Hindu School.</li>
        <li>In<b>1909</b> he passed his matriculation(entrance examination to higher studies).Later, he joined for Intermediate science course in Presidency College Calcutta,where his teachers included <b>Jagadish Chandra Bose, Sarada Prasanna Das, and Prafulla Chandra Ray</b>.</li>
        <li>Bose chose mixed (applied) mathematics for his BSc and passed the examinations standing first in <b>1913</b> and again stood first in the MSc mixed mathematics exam in <b>1915</b>.</li>
        <li>Bose Joined as research scholar in University of Calcutta after completing his MSc and started his studies on <b>Theory of Relativity</b>. </li>
        <li>In <b>1924</b>, Bose wrote paper deriving Planck's quantum radiation law without any reference to classical physics by using a novel way of counting states with identical particles</li>
        <li>This paper was seminal in creating the very important field of quantum statistics.Though not accepted at once for publication, he sent the article directly to <b>Albert Einstein</b> in Germany. Einstein, recognising the importance of the paper, translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the prestigious <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitschrift_f%C3%BCr_Physik" target="_blank">Zeitschrift für Physik</a></b>. As a result of this recognition, Bose was able to work for two years in European X-ray and crystallography laboratories, during which he worked with <b>Louis de Broglie, Marie Curie, and Einstein</b>.</li>
        <li>While presenting a lecture in University of Dhaka on theory of radiation and Ultraviolet catastrophe Bose was trying to show the modern theory in the time was sufficient enough to explain the theory. Later, Bose himself took the position that the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution would not be true for microscopic particles, where fluctuations due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle will be significant. Thus he stressed the probability of finding particles in the phase space, each state having volume h3, and discarding the distinct position and momentum of the particles.Bose made this theory in small article where he wrote "Planck's Law and the Hypothesis of Light Quanta" and sent it to Albert Einstein with a letter.Link for the picture of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Bose_letter.jpg" target="_blank">letter</a></li>
        <li>This work of Bose laid foundation to <i></b>Bose-Einstein Statistics </b></i>and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by <b>Einstein and Dirac</b>.</li>
  <li>By Bose theory Einstein described <i><b>Bose-Einstein condensate</b></i> he started to realize just how radical it was, and he compared it to wave/particle duality, saying that some particles didn't behave exactly like particles.</li>

  <h2> Honours</h2>
  <ui>
    <li>In <b>1937, Rabindranath Tagore</b> dedicated his only book on science, <b>Visva–Parichay</b>, to Satyendra Nath Bose.</li>
    <li>Bose was honoured with title <b>Padma Vibhushan</b> by the Indian Government in <b>1954</b>.</li>
    <li>In <b>1959</b>, he was appointed as the National Professor, the highest honour in the country for a scholar, a position he held for 15 years</li>
    <li>In <b>1986</b>, the <em><b>S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences</b></em> was established by an act of Parliament, Government of India, in Salt Lake, Calcutta.</li>
    <li>Bose became an adviser to then newly formed Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.</li>
    <li>He was the President of Indian Physical Society and the National Institute of Science.</li>
    <li>He was elected General President of the Indian Science Congress. He was the Vice-President and then the President of Indian Statistical Institute.</li>
    <li>In <b>1958</b>, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society.</li>
    <li>He passed way on February 4<sup>th</sup> <b>1974</b>(aged 80) Calcutta,India</li>
